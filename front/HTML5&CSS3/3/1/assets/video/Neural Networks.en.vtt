00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
So, now we're going to have some real fun here.

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.585
We're going to train a neural network to find traffic signs and images.

00:00:06.585 --> 00:00:08.445
This here well-known task.

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:12.245
Our absolute baseline for this is the work of Facebook's,

00:00:12.244 --> 00:00:16.414
Yann LeCun, who a while back got I think to 97 percent.

00:00:16.414 --> 00:00:21.799
So, the question is, can you beat the head of Facebook's AI team by doing a better job?

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.880
Now, Yann is a good friend.

00:00:22.879 --> 00:00:25.259
It has been more than a decade ago to be fair,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.200
but here's the challenge, beat Facebook.
